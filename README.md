## üó∫Ô∏è Overview

[Conditional Random Fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_random_field)
(CRF) are a family of discriminative graphical learning models that can be used
to model the dependencies between variables. The most common
form of CRFs are Linear-chain CRF, where a prediction depends on
an observed variable, as well as the prediction before and after it
(the *context*). Linear-chain CRFs are widely used in Natural Language Processing.

</p>

$$
P(Y | X) = \frac{1}{Z(X)} \prod_{i=1}^n{ \Psi_i(y_i, x_i) } \prod_{i=2}^n{ \Psi_{i-1,i}(y_{i-1}, y_i)}
$$

In 2006, Tang *et al.*[[1]](#ref1) introduced Tree-structured CRFs to model hierarchical
relationships between predicted variables, allowing dependencies between
a prediction variable and its parents and children.

<p align="center">
  <img height="280" src="https://github.com/althonos/torch-treecrf/raw/main/static/tree-structured-crf.svg?raw=true">
</p>

$$
P(Y | X) = \frac{1}{Z(X)} \prod_{i=1}^{n}{ \Psi_i(y_i, x_i) } \prod_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)}{ \Psi_{j,i}(y_j, y_i)}
$$

This package implements a generic Tree-structured CRF layer in PyTorch. The
layer can be stacked on top of a [linear layer](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html) to implement a proper Tree-structured CRF, or on any other kind of model
producing emission scores in log-space for every class of each label. Computation
of marginals is implemented using Belief Propagation[[2]](#ref2), allowing for
exact inference on trees[[3]](#ref3):

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(y_i | X)
& =
    \frac{1}{Z(X)} \Psi_i(y_i, x_i)
    & \underbrace{\prod_{j \in \mathcal{C}(i)}{\mu_{j \to i}(y_i)}} &
    & \underbrace{\prod_{j \in \mathcal{P}(i)}{\mu_{j \to i}(y_i)}} \\
& = \frac1Z \Psi_i(y_i, x_i)
    & \alpha_i(y_i) &
    & \beta_i(y_i)  \\
\end{aligned}
$$

where for every node $i$, the message from the parents $\mathcal{P}(i)$ and
the children $\mathcal{C}(i)$ is computed recursively with the sum-product algorithm[[4]](#ref4):

$$
\begin{aligned}
\forall j \in \mathcal{C}(i), \mu_{j \to i}(y_i) = \sum_{y_j}{
  \Psi_{i,j}(y_i, y_j)
  \Psi_j(y_j, x_j)
  \prod_{k \in \mathcal{C}(j)}{\mu_{k \to j}(y_j)}
} \\
\forall j \in \mathcal{P}(i), \mu_{j \to i}(y_i) = \sum_{y_j}{
  \Psi_{i,j}(y_i, y_j)
  \Psi_j(y_j, x_j)
  \prod_{k \in \mathcal{P}(j)}{\mu_{k \to j}(y_j)}
} \\
\end{aligned}
$$


*The implementation should be generic enough that any kind of [Directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) can be used as a label hierarchy,
not just trees.*

## üîß Installing

Install the `torch-treecrf` package directly from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/peptides)
which hosts universal wheels that can be installed with `pip`:
```console
$ pip install torch-treecrf
```

## üìã Features

- Encoding of directed graphs in an adjacency matrix, with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ retrieval of children and parents for any node, and $\mathcal{O}(N+E)$ storage.
- Support for any acyclic hierarchy representable as a [Directed Acyclic Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) and not just directed trees, allowing prediction of classes such as the [Gene Ontology](https://geneontology.org).
- Multiclass output, provided all the target labels have the same number of classes: $Y \in \left\\{ 0, .., C \right\\}^L$.
- Minibatch support, with vectorized computation of the messages $\alpha_i(y_i)$ and $\beta_i(y_i)$.


## üí° Example

To create a Tree-structured CRF, you must first define the tree encoding the
relationships between variables. Let's build a simple CRF for a root variable
with two children:

<p align="center">
  <img height="150" src="https://github.com/althonos/torch-treecrf/raw/main/static/example.svg?raw=true">
</p>

First, define an adjacency matrix $M$ representing the hierarchy, such that
$M_{i,j}$ is $1$ if $j$ is a parent of $i$:
```python
adjacency = torch.tensor([
    [0, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 0]
])
```

Then create the CRF by giving it the adjacency matrix as the hyperparameter:
```python
crf = torch_treecrf.TreeCRF(adjacency)
```

The `TreeCRF` expects local emission scores as a tensor of shape $(\star, L)$
where $\star$ is the minibatch size and $L$ the number of labels, and returns 
a tensor of logits of the same shape.

You can also use the CRF layer for cases where labels have more than two
classes; in which case use the `TreeCRFLayer` module, which expects an 
emission tensor of shape $(\star, C, L)$, where $\star$ is the minibatch size, $L$ the number of labels and $C$ the number of class per label, and returns
a tensor $log P(Y | X)$ of the same shape.
