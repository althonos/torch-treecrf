        By definition, in a CRF the conditional probability for is defined as:

        .. math::

            p(Y | X) = \frac1Z
                       \Prod_{i=1}^n{\Psi_i(y_i, x_i)}
                       \Prod_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)}

        where :math:`\mathcal{N}(i)` is set of neighbours of label :math:`i`
        in the tree.

        Marginal probabilities for label :math:`y_i` are obtained by
        summing over conditional probabilities. Once factoring the messages
        passed over the model graph with the *belief propagation*, we get:

        .. math::

            p(y_i | x_i) = \frac1Z \Psi_i(y_i, x_i)
                           \Prod_{j in \mathcal{N}(i) \mu_{j \to i}(y_i)}

        where message from children to parents are defined by recurence,
        :math:`\forall i \in \{ 1, .., n \} , \forall j \in \mathcal{C}(i)`,

        .. math::

            \mu_{j \to i}(y_i) = \sum_{y_j}{
                \Psi_{i,j}(y_i, y_j)
                \Psi_j(y_j, x_j)
                \Prod_{k \in \mathcal{C}(j)}{ \mu_{k \to j}(y_j) }
            }

        (and conversely for messages from parents to children). This
        reccurence relationship is known as the Sum Product Algorithm.

        The partition function is computed so that the probabilities are
        well defined, i.e. that they sum to one for every label of class
        :math:`i`:

        .. math::

            Z = \sum_{y_i}{
                \Psi_i(y_i, x_i)
                \Prod_{j in \mathcal{N}(i)}{\mu_{j \to i}(y_i)}
            }

        In log-space, the marginals can be expressed as a sum:

        .. math::

            \log p(y_i | x_i) = \log \Psi_i(y_i, x_i)
                                - \log Z
                                + \sum_{j in \mathcal{N}(i)}{
                                    \log \mu_{j \to i}(y_i)
                                }

        For a tree CRF in particular, the last term can be decomposed in two
        components: the sum of messages passed from the parents, and the sum
        of messages passed from the children:

        .. math::

            \begin{aligned}
                \sum_{j in \mathcal{N}(i)}{ \log \mu_{j \to i}(y_i) }
             & = \sum_{j in \mathcal{C}(i)}{ \log \mu_{j \to i}(y_i) }
             & + \sum_{j in \mathcal{P}(i)}{ \log \mu_{j \to i}(y_i) } \\
             & = \Alpha_i(y_i) & + \Beta_i(y_i)
            \end{aligned}

        :math:`\Alpha` and :math:`\Beta` can be computed efficiently with
        the forward-backward algorithm, and stored in a tensor of shape
        :math:`(*, C, L)`.
